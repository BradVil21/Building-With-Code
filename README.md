# Building A Calculator ðŸ–©

Project Description: This project focuses on developing a fully functional calculator using Python. It demonstrates my understanding of core programming concepts such as functions, user input handling, and error management. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with plans to expand its functionality to include advanced features such as exponentiation, square roots, and trigonometric calculations.

<b>Key Features:</b>
<div>
  <ul>
<li>Interactive User Interface: A command-line interface that allows users to input numbers and operations easily.</li>
<li>Error Handling: Built-in checks to manage invalid inputs, division by zero, and other common issues.</li>
<li>Modular Design: Organized code with reusable functions for each operation, ensuring clarity and scalability.</li>
<li>Scalability: Room for enhancements like adding scientific functions or creating a graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
  </ul>
